# Retro Remake SuperStation One Console: A New Era for PlayStation 1 Games

The **Retro Remake SuperStation One** is the latest retro console designed to bring classic PlayStation 1 (PS1) games to life without the need for software emulation. Instead, it uses **FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array)** technology, which allows it to run PS1 games natively, offering a level of accuracy and authenticity that traditional emulation can’t match.

Developed by **Taki Udon** and his company **Retro Remake**, the SuperStation One represents a modern approach to retro gaming, featuring a compact design inspired by the original PlayStation console. But it’s not just about looking the part; this device brings some impressive modern features to the table.

## Design: Nostalgia Meets Innovation

At first glance, the SuperStation One is unmistakably reminiscent of the original PS1. The classic **white-and-gray color scheme** and large buttons on top evoke memories of the iconic console, but the design is more compact and streamlined, making it a better fit for modern living rooms.

One key difference between the SuperStation One and the original PlayStation is that this console **does not include a disc drive**. However, for those still holding onto their old game discs, Retro Remake offers the optional **SuperDock**. This accessory allows you to play original PS1 discs, adds four additional USB ports, and even includes an **M.2 SSD slot** for digitalizing your personal collection of PlayStation 1 games.

The **SuperStation One** also features modern amenities such as **Wi-Fi**, **Bluetooth**, and **USB connectivity**, making it an excellent choice for those who want to relive the past while still being able to connect to today’s digital world.

## Performance: FPGA for Authenticity

The standout feature of the SuperStation One is its use of **FPGA** technology, which eliminates the need for software emulation. Instead of relying on processing power to simulate the behavior of a PlayStation 1, the FPGA replicates the hardware of the original system directly, ensuring that PS1 games run exactly as they did on the original console. This level of precision ensures that you get the same performance and accuracy you’d expect from the original hardware.

This makes the SuperStation One ideal for purists who want an authentic gaming experience. In addition, the console supports **original PS1 memory cards and controllers**, allowing you to fully recreate the PS1 gaming experience, right down to the classic controller in your hands.

## Game Launching: NFC and USB Connectivity

For those who have kept their **PS1 game collection** intact, the **SuperStation One** offers a novel approach to game launching. With its **built-in NFC** capabilities, the console can automatically recognize and launch games when the corresponding game case is placed near the device. This is thanks to **NFC stickers** that can be added to your game cases, offering a convenient and fun way to access your games.

However, if you don’t have your original discs, you can still enjoy your collection. Games can be launched from a **USB drive** containing ROM files, which can easily be transferred onto the SuperStation One.

## Video and Audio Output: Retro Meets Modern Displays

While the SuperStation One is primarily focused on delivering an authentic retro gaming experience, it also supports **modern display technology**. The console provides **analog video output**, which is perfect for connecting to **CRT televisions**, bringing the full retro gaming experience to life with your old-school setup. For those using newer displays, the system also supports **HDMI output**, ensuring you can enjoy crisp visuals on high-definition screens as well.

In terms of audio, the SuperStation One features standard audio output options like **3.5mm analog audio** and **TOSLINK digital audio**, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of sound systems.

## Ports and Connectivity: Versatility for the Modern Gamer

The SuperStation One features a number of connectivity options to suit a variety of needs:

- **USB Type-C** (Power)
- **3x USB Type-A** (for controllers, storage, and other peripherals)
- **Ethernet** (for wired internet connection)
- **TF Card Slot** (for additional storage expansion)
- **Dual Combo PS1 SNAC Ports** (for authentic PS1 controller compatibility)
- **IO Expansion Slot for SuperDock** (for future expansions)

With **dual SNAC ports**, you can connect your original PS1 controllers, ensuring you get the most authentic feel when playing your favorite games.
