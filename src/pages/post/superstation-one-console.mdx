The Retro Remake SuperStation One brings classic PlayStation 1 (PS1) games to life with FPGA technology, offering a true, hardware-level gaming experience. Developed by Taki Udon, this retro console is a modern take on the original PS1, but with added features for the present-day gamer.

The SuperStation One mimics the PS1’s iconic design but in a more compact form. It lacks a disc drive, but the optional SuperDock accessory allows you to play original PS1 discs and adds four USB ports plus an M.2 SSD slot for digital collections. Modern amenities such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and USB connectivity are also included.

The standout feature is the FPGA technology, which replicates the PS1’s hardware, offering unrivaled authenticity over emulation. The system supports original PS1 controllers and memory cards for a fully immersive experience. For game launching, the console integrates NFC technology to recognize and launch games when their cases are nearby. If you don’t have the physical discs, games can also be loaded via USB.

The SuperStation One supports both analog and HDMI outputs, ensuring compatibility with vintage CRT TVs or modern displays. It’s also equipped with several connectivity options, including USB Type-C, Ethernet, and TF card slots for expanded storage.

Available for pre-order at $149.99 for the Founders Edition, the SuperStation One offers an unmatched retro gaming experience for nostalgic and new players alike.
