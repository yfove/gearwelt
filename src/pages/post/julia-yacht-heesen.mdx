# Julia Yacht by Heesen: A Masterpiece of Luxury and Innovation

The _Julia_ yacht by Heesen redefines modern luxury on the water. Built at Heesen’s Oss shipyard, this 50-meter motor yacht blends cutting-edge performance with exceptional design. Her sleek, aerodynamic exterior, created by Clifford Denn, ensures both efficiency and visual appeal, while the interiors, designed by Reymond Langton Design, feature Art Deco-inspired elements paired with modern touches.

Powered by twin MTU 8V 4000 M63 engines, the _Julia_ cruises at 12 knots and reaches a top speed of 15 knots, with an impressive range of up to 4,000 nautical miles. Her 60,000-liter fuel capacity ensures long-distance voyages are seamless, while her 20,000-liter fresh water tank allows for uninterrupted travel.

Inside, _Julia_ accommodates 10 guests in five luxurious suites, designed with the finest materials and technology. The yacht also hosts up to 10 crew members for exceptional service. Leisure options include a beach club with a swim platform, a fully equipped gym, and several alfresco dining areas. The sundeck features a Jacuzzi and ample lounging space.

_Julia_ is a perfect fusion of design, performance, and luxury—an epitome of yachting excellence.
