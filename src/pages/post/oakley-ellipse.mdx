Oakley’s Ellipse is a bold reinterpretation of the brand’s design DNA — a frame that feels both nostalgic and unapologetically modern. Its rounded profile and curved lines nod to the past, while details like the sculpted lens shape and sharp contours give it **a distinctly futuristic edge**.

Built with Oakley’s **lightweight O Matter™ frame**, the Ellipse is designed to go from morning to dusk without weighing you down. The earsocks and interchangeable nose pads are made with **Unobtainium®**, a soft material that grips better the more you move — making these sunglasses **surprisingly secure and comfortable** even during long, active days.

Where the Ellipse really stands out is in the optics. Oakley’s **Prizm™ Lens Technology** subtly enhances color and contrast, giving everything around you just a bit more pop and clarity. It’s one of those features you don’t think you need until you’ve used it — and then it’s hard to go back.

In short, this is Oakley doing what it does best: combining function, heritage, and style into **a frame that’s built to be worn, not just admired**.
