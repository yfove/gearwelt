The **Ricoh GR IV** builds on the legacy of one of photography’s most beloved compact series, combining professional-grade performance with unmatched portability. Weighing in at just **262 grams**, it’s an ideal companion for street photographers, travelers, and creators who value speed, discretion, and image quality.

At its core is a **25.7-megapixel back-illuminated APS-C sensor**, powered by the advanced **GR ENGINE 7** image processor. This new pairing delivers stunning image clarity, even in low-light conditions, while minimizing noise and maximizing detail. The fixed **18.3mm f/2.8 GR lens** (28mm full-frame equivalent) has been newly redesigned to enhance edge-to-edge sharpness and reduce distortion, ensuring crisp results from every frame.

One of the GR IV’s standout features is its **five-axis shake reduction system**, a first for the GR lineup, offering reliable handheld shooting and reducing blur in challenging lighting scenarios. Ricoh also introduces a new **Snap Distance-Priority AE** mode, designed to deliver sharp focus at pre-set distances—perfect for fast-paced street work.

Startup time is blazing fast at **0.6 seconds**, allowing you to capture fleeting moments instantly. For video creators, the GR IV includes a new **Cinema Mode**, applying film-like grain, tones, and color profiles that give footage a nostalgic and artistic feel.

The camera features a **3-inch HD LCD display** with an **Outdoor Monitor mode** for improved visibility in direct sunlight. Built-in **Bluetooth and Wi-Fi** support seamless connectivity through the GR WORLD mobile app, enabling easy sharing and remote control functionality.

Constructed from **magnesium alloy**, the GR IV is durable yet light, with a refined grip for added comfort during extended shooting sessions. Other thoughtful enhancements include **53GB of internal storage**, **anti-stain coatings** on the lens, **Full HD video recording**, and **extended battery life** for all-day shooting.

Available now for **pre-order**, the Ricoh GR IV begins shipping this **September**. Compact, intuitive, and powerful—the GR IV is more than just a camera; it’s a creative companion built for everyday excellence.
