The **Valve Steam Frame** rockets virtual reality into a new dimension, a sleek wireless headset that blends standalone swagger with SteamOS brilliance. Freshly unveiled alongside a reborn Steam Controller, this featherlight 440-gram marvel—powered by a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2—delivers instant VR and flatscreen gaming thrills, no PC required.

Sculpted with dual 2160 x 2160 LCDs at a silky 144Hz, it boasts pancake lenses for edge-to-edge clarity and a 110-degree field of view. Foveated Streaming, driven by low-latency eye-tracking, sharpens where you gaze, while four high-res cameras ensure flawless inside-out tracking. Dual stereo speakers hum with high-fidelity audio, and a 21.6Wh battery in the swappable headstrap keeps adventures untethered.

Fresh tweaks include a plug-and-play 6GHz wireless adapter for PC streaming, 16GB RAM, and up to 1TB UFS storage with microSD expansion. Paired with ergonomic controllers featuring magnetic thumbsticks and 6-DOF tracking, it’s ready for everything from Half-Life: Alyx to Android ports, all Steam-verified for seamless play.

Set for early 2026 with dev kits rolling out, the Steam Frame fuses PC power with Quest-like freedom. Whether battling in VR epics or chilling with flatscreen classics, it’s a reminder that true immersion thrives in boundless, cable-free joy.
