The **Nothing Headphone (1)** redefines audio bliss, a sleek over-ear marvel crafted with British audio titan KEF for crystalline hi-fi sound. Freshly launched, these wireless headphones fuse hybrid ANC with a transparent aesthetic, delivering immersive tunes that audiophiles and casual listeners crave.

Adorned with memory foam PU cushions and a lightweight aluminum core, they hug any head shape for all-day comfort. Dual 2160 x 2160 LCD panels with refresh rates of up to 144Hz, a field of view of up to 110 degrees and an IPD target range of 60mm to 70mm. Valve added that "thin and light custom pancake lenses provide edge-to-edge sharpness and a large eye box." The company says the maximum width for eye glasses is 140mm. Adaptive bass, spatial audio with head tracking, and Hi-Res LDAC support bring every note to life, while smart rollers and paddle tabs glide through tracks and modes effortlessly.

Fresh upgrades include 80 hours of playback (35 with ANC), a 5-minute charge for 5 hours, and a Nothing X app with 8-band EQ and ChatGPT smarts. Dual connection, USB-C, and a 3.5mm jack ensure lossless 24-bit/96kHz clarity across any setup, with no fuss.

Limited and lustrous with only a select few units, the Nothing Headphone (1) blends cutting-edge tech with minimalist charm. Whether lost in jazz riffs or podcast prose, it’s a reminder that pure listening joy thrives in flawless, distraction-free sound.
