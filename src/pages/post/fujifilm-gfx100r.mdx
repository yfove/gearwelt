Fujifilm's GFX100R redefines medium format photography, blending portability with unmatched detail and image quality. Weighing just **1.62 pounds**, it’s the lightest in the GFX series, making it a practical choice for professionals who demand high performance without the bulk. Equipped with a **102-megapixel sensor**, the GFX100R delivers stunning image clarity and detail, capturing every nuance in even the most complex scenes.

Distinct from other GFX models, the GFX100R features a fixed **35mm lens** (equivalent to **28mm in full-frame**), a versatile focal length designed for everything from landscape to street photography. The permanently affixed f/4 lens has a minimum focusing distance of just **20 centimeters**, allowing for creative close-ups, and its focal length can be digitally extended to 45mm, 63mm, and 80mm for added flexibility.

Fujifilm draws inspiration from its X100VI series for the GFX100R’s design, incorporating a precision-crafted aluminum top plate that enhances its sleek, compact form. The camera includes several unique features: a **leaf shutter system** for silent, high-speed operation, the ability to sync flash at any shutter speed, and an aspect ratio dial offering nine different ratios. A built-in **four-stop ND filter** provides additional creative control.

On the back, you'll find a **3.15-inch touchscreen LCD** and a **5.76-million dot high-resolution electronic viewfinder (EVF)**, perfect for those who prefer a more traditional viewfinder experience. The GFX100R’s compact design means no **in-body image stabilization (IBIS)**, a trade-off for its size and portability.

Available in **April** for **$4,899.95**, the GFX100R offers a refined alternative to other high-end options, including the Leica Q3, bringing a new level of precision and style to your photography.
