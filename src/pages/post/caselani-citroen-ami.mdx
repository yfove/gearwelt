# Caselani Citroen AMI: A Blend of Retro Charm and Modern Technology

The **Caselani Citroen AMI** is one of the most exciting collaborations in the electric vehicle (EV) world, offering a futuristic, yet retro aesthetic. Combining the iconic Citroën AMI with a modern design twist, this unique electric vehicle (EV) is turning heads with its innovative approach to personal transportation.

## What Makes the Caselani Citroën AMI Special?

In essence, the Citroën AMI was already a standout in the world of compact electric cars, but when the Italian design studio **Caselani** stepped in, the AMI received a truly special makeover. The result? A classic, yet forward-thinking electric vehicle that is practical, stylish, and perfect for urban mobility. Caselani’s involvement adds a layer of artistry and innovation that takes the AMI from being just a functional electric vehicle to something uniquely eye-catching.

## A Retro-Modern Design

Caselani’s custom body kit introduces elements that pay homage to the **Citroën Type H van**, one of the brand’s most beloved designs from the 1950s. The mix of old-world charm and sleek, contemporary lines results in a vehicle that is both timeless and highly relevant for today’s eco-conscious drivers.

### Key Design Features:

- **Distinctive Front End**: The AMI’s small but functional frame is enhanced by the design language of the classic Citroën Type H.
- **Compact and Functional**: Measuring just under 2.5 meters long, the AMI is built for nimbleness, ideal for tight city streets.
- **Functional Aesthetics**: The custom body kit creates a perfect balance between utility and style, making the AMI stand out in a crowd of otherwise minimalist EVs.

## Electric Performance: Efficiency Meets Practicality

At its core, the **Caselani Citroën AMI** isn’t just about looks—it also delivers in terms of performance. Powered by a small electric motor and a 5.5 kWh battery, the AMI offers a maximum speed of around 28 mph and a range of 46 miles on a single charge. This makes it a perfect vehicle for city commutes and short trips.

- **Range**: 46 miles on a single charge
- **Speed**: Limited to 28 mph for urban-friendly use
- **Charging**: Full charge takes approximately 3 hours via a standard 220V outlet.

## The Future of Urban Mobility

In a world where space is becoming increasingly scarce and the need for sustainability is greater than ever, the Caselani Citroën AMI stands as a perfect example of what the future of urban mobility could look like: small, efficient, and stylish.

This combination of retro style and electric technology makes the AMI a trendsetter in the EV market. Its blend of heritage and modernity creates a product that is appealing to both enthusiasts of classic cars and lovers of innovative new technology.

## Conclusion: A New Era of EV Design
