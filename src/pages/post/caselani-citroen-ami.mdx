The **Caselani Citroën AMI** is a unique collaboration that merges a futuristic yet retro aesthetic, making it one of the most exciting electric vehicles (EV) on the market today. By combining the iconic Citroën AMI with a design twist from the renowned Italian design studio **Caselani**, this compact EV is turning heads with its innovative approach to urban mobility.

The Citroën AMI was already a standout in the world of small electric cars, but when Caselani added their custom body kit, it transformed into something truly special. The result is a perfect blend of style, functionality, and eco-friendly driving, making it the perfect choice for the modern urban driver who values both heritage and innovation.

Caselani’s design adds elements inspired by the **Citroën Type H van**, one of the brand’s most beloved designs from the 1950s. The vehicle’s design is timeless yet perfectly suited for today’s eco-conscious world. Its compact frame, just under 2.5 meters long, ensures it's perfectly suited for tight city streets, while the modern custom body kit gives it an undeniable flair that stands out from other minimalist EVs.

Powered by a small electric motor and a 5.5 kWh battery, the **Caselani Citroën AMI** offers an efficient yet practical solution for city commutes. It reaches speeds of up to 28 mph, with a range of 46 miles on a single charge, making it ideal for short trips and daily use. Charging takes approximately 3 hours via a standard 220V outlet, adding to its convenience for everyday drivers.

This EV exemplifies the future of urban mobility—small, efficient, and full of character. With its retro style and modern electric technology, the AMI is a trendsetter in the EV market and a fun, practical choice for anyone seeking an urban-friendly vehicle.

The **Caselani Citroën AMI** proves that electric vehicles can blend practicality with style and heritage with modernity, offering a unique driving experience that’s as enjoyable as it is sustainable.
